    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Hao Lu. I specialize in human detection, depth image processing, and multimodal learning. I completed my Ph.D in EE at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

    <h2>My Research</h2>
    <p>
      I'd like to share an interesting work here. The goal of my work is to build an occupancy detection system in commercial office build. This is a foundamental work for smart conference room and adaptive HVAC and lightening control system. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the privacy issue, we build wireless sensor network using STM VL53L5 sensors. Here's a video to show the reading of sensors.

      Sensor readings.
    </video>
    <p>
      To save the installation cost and sensor engergy cost, we sparsely install it in the office room. Here's a video to show the Counting result in office room. The details of this work publiced in "Lu, H., Tuzikas, A., & Radke, R. J. (2021). A zone-level occupancy counting system for commercial office spaces using low-resolution time-of-flight sensors. Energy and Buildings, 252, 111390."

      This work can answer "how many person are there in a certain zone?". This is the foundamantal information for HVAC control system. But for smart conference room, we need information in more precise details, like current location and future trajectories. Here I use Inverse Reinforcement Learning to do the trajectory and destination prediction using our sensor system. Here are three demo videos. The research detaisl will summarize and submit soon.
